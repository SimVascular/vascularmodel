SVCardiacDemoModel,"This data can be used to demonstrate the automatic left ventricle model construction capability of SimVascular. The model construction pipeline includes machine-learning-based whole heart segmentation, surface editing, registration, and meshing techniques to automatically construct simulation-ready LV meshes and boundary conditions from modeling of the LV hemodynamics.\nFor more information, please download the associated PDF. The weights of the neural network are included as a separate folder in this project download.","Kong, F., & Shadden, S.C. (2020). Automating Model Generation for Image-based Cardiac Flow Simulation.
